# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** A developer can open VS Code, sign in once, and go from browsing their A365 workspace to running or deploying a script — without leaving the editor or hand-crafting API calls.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — side panel

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-19

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Side panel tree depth: Workspace → Projects + Scripts (two children per workspace)
- Pre-roadmap: Remote script editing: edit in VS Code, explicit publish action (not auto-save)
- Pre-roadmap: Remote execution logs: Output Channel (existing pattern)
- Pre-roadmap: No bundler in v1 — plain tsc output, `vsce` for packaging
- [Phase 01-packaging]: Generate the 128x128 extension icon programmatically via scripts/generate-icon.js (zero-dependency Node script) rather than committing a hand-drawn asset
- [Phase 01-packaging]: Bumped extension version 0.0.2 to 0.1.0 to mark the first packaged build
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-packaging]: Use main-only CI trigger with explicit npm run compile before npm run package for fail-fast tsc errors — Per D-08/D-09; redundant compile is acceptable for clearer failure step

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `extension.ts` is 484 lines mixing UI orchestration and subprocess management — Phase 2 side panel work is the natural forcing function to extract `src/runner.ts`
- Tokens passed as env vars to Python subprocess (known concern; acceptable for v1, document it)
